Around the world, millions of individuals suffer from what they think is unrequited love while constantly being afraid and hesitant to confess their true feelings towards those they admire, afraid of the countless possibilities and outcomes after their confession. Because of the fear of rejection, they continue to hide away and tuck in their true emotions and intentions. They Love Me, They Love Me Not is a dating game we will create that will show afraid individuals how to build up courage and confidence to do what they must do and what actions to take once confessing to that certain someone, whether facing rejection or reciprocation. This game aims to teach valuable lessons of love, trust, acceptance, and letting go, and to let the audience know what proper actions to take and how to deal with outcomes that may happen after confessing. To show whether the user’s choices and efforts are recognized or not, we intend to show them their outcome or ending at the very end, which are the few endings we will implement. Each ending will show what will become of the user’s relationship with their crush, whether marriage, or forever friends. This game was created by Zeryl Gonadan, Lordwyn Demoni, and Krisha Villa (or, the deluludevs 🤪)
